## Project Requirements
### For the project we had to create a tower defense game with the following:
1. Different difficulty levels
2. 3 distinct towers (ours are Bug, Virus, RootKit)
3. 3 distinct enemies (ours are Firewall, Encryption, Antivirus)
4. A way to win and lose
5. An economy including a shop for upgrading and purchasing towers
6. A final boss (ours is Physical Ingress)
7. Statistic trackers
8. Unit tests to validate functionality

### Additional features we included:
1. Dynamic map generation - Maps made using a bitmap of path and non-path bits (1 and 0). The code turns this into a map and uses a DFS pathfinding algo to generate the map.
2. Clock synced events.
